# Godot Scalable Inventory
## About
A Scalable inventory for Godot

### Tile inventory
Originally, it was inspired by hamburgear, but rewritten by me:
1. All nodes are based on Control nodes, and are not dependent on 2D nodes.
2. Items are based on resources, which is good for Godot game developer
3. Configurable quantity of items, that are outside inventory.
4. Added auto-placing items.
