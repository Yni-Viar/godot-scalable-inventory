# Godot Scalable Inventory
A Scalable inventory for Godot

Originally, it was made by hamburgear (under Unlicense), but improved by me:
1. All nodes are based on Control nodes, and are not dependent on 2D nodes.
2. Items are based on resources, which is good for Godot game developer
3. Configurable quantity of items, that are outside inventory.
